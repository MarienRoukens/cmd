## Address bar autocomplete

You can install the [cmd.ms] browser extension to get autocomplete support for all the commands right in the address bar, plus you can avoid typing .cmd.ms each time.

Once the extension is installed you can:

* Open a new tab
* Type **c** and press **SPACE** or **TAB**
* Type in the cmd.ms shortcut. eg. **adusers**

## cmd.ms/[command]

[cmd.ms] also supports the **cmd.ms/[command]** format for those who prefer it over **[command].cmd.ms**.

Having said that **[command].cmd.ms** is better in the long run due to autocomplete filling in the cmd.ms suffix as soon as you type in the [command] in the browser window.
